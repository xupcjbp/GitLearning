presentGraphics()
	1. OpenGL stores drawing frames in a back buffer and copy them into window buffer using this function
	2. like XFlush
OpenGL library is platform dependent; thus, it is likely that there is a base windowing system that wraps around it to maintain consistent code bases
On the other hand, OpenGL code does talk to hardware direclty (if so, it would be hardware dependent). Instead, it goes through the graphic card drivers.
	1. some functions of OpenGL needs to be dynamically linked with functionality of graphic drivers; usually there is libraries that take care of this
