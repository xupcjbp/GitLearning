Variant template is in C++17
	variant<int, string, STRUCT> var: variable var can be either an integer, string, or a struct
	A type variant is itself an object
	The actual value of the object is stored in the variant object
	Must use member functions to check type and access the value (access usually comes after checking since the wrong type access will result in throw)
	Specifically, the checker is holds_alternative<GUESSED_TYPE>(var)
	The accessor is std::get<TYPE>(var)
Union is a special type data in C that allows multiple different data types to be stored in one memroy location
	Only one data type can contain information at any given time
	Definition of a union looks like a struct (keyword 'union' instead of 'struct')
	Memory allocated for union will be large enough to hold the largest data type defined in it
	REMINDER: in C language, must use 'union TYPE_NAME VARIABLE_NAME' instead of 'TYPE_NAME VARIABLE_NAME', just like struct in C.
	The latest variable being written in there will corrupt any other value that was in it
	Likely going to need a tag to indicate the type of data the current value represents
Type 'enum' is essentially a structure that renames some existing data structures.
	It is itself a struct.
Observation: switch statement is essentially a compiler managed control flow block using goto.
	Each case declaration is a goto statement; no exit condition by default
While in normal mode of Vim editor, keyboard 'u' is undo last change.
:%s/TO_BE_REPLACED_STRING/REPLACING_STRING/gc
	In Vim editor, search the text document for specified string pattern and replace it with given string pattern; inquire permission before operation
/STRING
	In Vim editor, search for the occurrence of specified string pattern
C language does not have built-in boolean data structure
	#include <stdbool.h>
<stdlib.h> is the C standard library in C
	When including library in C language, use *.h
	stdout, stdin, stderr, \n, perror, printf
	perror does not take formatted string, only string
	printf takes a formatted string
		%c (character), %d (decimal integer), %f (decimal floating point), %s (string), %e (scientific notation using e)
<cstdlib> is the C standard library in C++
	When including library in C++, there is no extension
	cout, cin, cerr, endl
<string.h> is the string library for C language
